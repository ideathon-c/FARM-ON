        <h1 align=center><b>SUSTAINABLE FARMING</b></h1>
        <div class="container">Sustainable farming or, in a broader term, Sustainable agriculture is using farming practices considering the ecological cycles. It is also sensitive towards the microorganisms and their equations with the environment at large. In simpler terms, sustainable farming is farming ecologically by promoting methods and practices that are economically viable, environmentally sound and protect public health. 

        It does not only concentrate on the economic aspect of farming, but also on the use of non-renewable factors in the process thoughtfully and effectively. This contributes to the growth of nutritious and healthy food as well as brings up the standard of living of the farmer.
        Our environment, and subsequently, our ecology have become an area of concern for us over the last few decades. This has increasingly led us to contemplate, innovate and employ alternate methods or smaller initiatives to save our ecology.

        One such initiative is sustainable farming. It simply means the production of food, plants and animal products using farming techniques that prove to be beneficial for public health and promote economic profitability. It draws and learns from organic farming.</div>
        <h2><b>METHODS</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3> Make use of Renewable Energy Sources</h3></li>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-6">The first and most important practice is the use of alternate sources of energy. The use of solar, hydro-power or wind-farms is ecology friendly. Farmers can use solar panels to store solar energy and use it for electrical fencing and running of pumps and heaters.


                    Running river water can be a source of hydroelectric power and can be used to run various machines on farms. Similarly, farmers can use geothermal heat pumps to dig beneath the earth and can take advantage of earth’s heat.</div>

                        In these innovative farming techniques, plants grow without soil and get nourished through specialized nutrients that are added to water.

                        In hydroponic systems, crops are grown with the roots directly in a mineral solution or with the roots in an inert medium like gravel or perlite. Aquaponics combines the raising of aquatic animals (such as fish) with the growing of hydroponic crops.

                        The water containing nutrients resulting from the mineralization of the waste material from the aquaculture fish is used to nourish the hydroponic plants. After the plants use the water, the water gets purified and then re-circulated back into the system to be reused by the fish.

                        Both hydroponic and aquaponic systems are available in a variety of scales, from small home-scale systems to commercial-scale systems.

                        Integrated pest management is a combination of pest control techniques for identifying and observing pests in the initial stages. One also needs to realize that not all pests are harmful, and therefore it makes more sense to let them co-exist with the crop than spend money eliminating them.
                        Targeted spraying works best when one need to remove specific pests only. This not only helps you to spray pest on the selected areas but will also protect wildlife from getting affected.

                        Crop rotation is a tried and tested method used since ancient farming practices proven to keep the soil healthy and nutritious. Crop rotation has a logical explanation to it – the crops are picked in a pattern so that the crops planted this season replenish the nutrients and salts from the soil that were absorbed by the previous crop cycle. For example, row crops are planted after grains to balance the used nutrients.

                        It involves growing multiple crop species in one area. These species often complement each other, and greater diversity of products can be produced at one plot while fully utilizing available resources. High biodiversity makes the system more resilient to weather fluctuations, promotes a balanced diet and applies natural mechanisms for preservation of soil fertility.
