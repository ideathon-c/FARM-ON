        <h1 align=center><b>SMART FARMING IN INDIA</b></h1>
        Smart farming is farming which involves higher and advanced productivity with existing farming practices. It used to enhance production efficiency and the quality of farming products. With all this, smart farming increases farmer’s quality of living by minimising heavy and monotonous work.

        In short, we can say that smart farming is all about reducing waste, developing productivity and full use of resources with remote sensing. Smart farming is known by precision farming too. It involves using various technologies, the internet of things (IoT) devices, big data analytics, remote sensing, artificial intelligence and robotics. It is scientifically proven that using these technologies increases profit, minimises waste and maintains the environment’s quality.

                        Indoor vertical farming is the procedure of growing plants in closed and controlled environments. With this method, plants mounted vertically, and it takes less land space to grow compared to traditional farming. Vertical farms don’t require soil for plants to grow, and in this method, the labour force reduced too. It is the best and the first smart farming technique in India.

                        Farm automation is the up gradation in farming machines and equipment. To accomplish this, companies are working on this. They are working on autonomous tractors, automatic watering, develop drones, robotics innovation, and seeding robots. The companies not only provide quality innovative machinery but make these machines affordable for the farmers.

                        Livestock provides much needed products, and in our country, livestock is the most ignorant part of farming. New innovations over the 8 to 10 years created huge changes and improvements to the industry. It helps in managing and tracking livestock easily and comfortably. These technologies come in genetics, nutritional technologies, digital technology, and more.

                        Indian agriculture witnessed an increase in the greenhouse in large scale. It is urban centred and capital infused. As the market demand increases dramatically, the trend of the greenhouse is increasing in recent years. A modern greenhouse is now becoming automated control systems, tech-heavy and using LED lights for growing environment.

                        Recent precision agriculture companies are introducing technologies that permit Indian farmers to boost production. It is done by controlling pest stress, micro-climates, moisture levels, and soil conditions. In precision agriculture, farmers get appropriate techniques for growing crops and planting that enhance efficiency and income.

                        Blockchain used to resolve important issues, including food traceability, supply chain inefficiency, safety recalls, and food fraud in the food system. It creates a market for premium products with verification and transparency. This verifies transactions that are securely shared with every seller or not. It helps in creating transparency in the marketplace and food supply.

                        With the increase in digital agriculture and technologies, opportunities for the farmers increased too. Farmers can gather 24 hours of information by UAVs, satellites, and remote sensors. All these technologies can monitor the health of plants, temperature, soil condition, humidity, etc. Now farmers can get a better understanding of the ground of innovative technologies. These can help them to improve productivity.
